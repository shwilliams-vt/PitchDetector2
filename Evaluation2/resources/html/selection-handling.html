    <p class="half-width blurb">
        To specify when to activate our NVVI tool's pitch detection, we've decided that <span class="italic">transient detection</span> will be the method of choice. In short, <span class="italic">transient detection</span> means the detection of some abrupt and atypically loud impulse in the audio signal.

         Our tool interprets <span class="italic">TWO TRANSIENTS</span> as a signal to toggle the tool on and off. For example, you can do this by clapping your hands twice consecutively near the microphone! Listen to the demo below.
