    <p class="half-width blurb">
        To specify when you want to use our NVVI tool, we decided that <span class="italic">transient detection</span> will be a way to toggle the abledness of our tool. In short, <span class="italic">transient detection</span> means a detection of some abrupt and atypically loud impulse in the audio signal.

    <p class="half-width blurb">
         Our tool interprets <span class="italic">TWO TRANSIENTS</span> as a signal to toggle the tool on and off. For example, you can do this by clapping your hands twice consecutively near the microphone! Listen to the demo below.
