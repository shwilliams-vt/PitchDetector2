        Our NVVI tool to be used in this study is a pitch-based tool that allows you to control parameters with the pitch of your humming/whistling/singing. Specifically, changing the pitch of whichever sound you produce up and down will translate into an increase and decrease of the parameter, respectively. However, there is an important design consideration we haven't considered yet.
