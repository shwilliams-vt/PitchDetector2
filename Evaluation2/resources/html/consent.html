    <h3>WHAT SHOULD I KNOW?</h3>
    <p class="three-qtr-width blurb ">
        If you decide to participate in this study, you will complete several surveys and tests. As part of the study, you will perform tests using a pitch-based NVVI prototype and computer mouse to control HTML sliders. You will also respond to a demographic questionnaire, post-test surveys (including a NASA Task-Load Index questionnaire), and a System Usability Scale (SUS) survey. You will be prompted to allow microphone access to run the study, as such audio data will be input to the NVVI tools. Data being collected in this study to analyze the effectiveness of this NVVI tool includes metrics from tasks, like time taken and sampled slider locations, and questionnaire results. The study should take approximately 30 minutes of your time. You should work alone in a quiet setting for the duration of the study to minimize noise interference. We do not anticipate any risks from completing this study.

        You can choose whether to be in this study or not.  If you volunteer to be in this study, you may withdraw at any time without consequences of any kind.  You may also refuse to answer any questions you donâ€™t want to answer and remain in the study. The investigator may withdraw you from this research if circumstances arise which warrant doing so.
