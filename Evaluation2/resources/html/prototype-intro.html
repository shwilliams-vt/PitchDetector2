        You can toggle the tool on and off by creating 2 transients in short time (e.g. clapping twice). The status will be listed as ON or OFF. 
    </p>
    <p class="half-width blurb">
        When first turned on, you will see that the tool is <span class="italic">listening</span> for a pitch. Once it confidently detects one, a <span class="italic">session</span> will begin, and you will see the detected pitch of your whistling/humming. 
    </p>
    <p class="half-width blurb">
    When the tool loses confidence (e.g. you stop whistling/humming), it will go back to the listening stage and the <span class="italic">session</span> will end.
