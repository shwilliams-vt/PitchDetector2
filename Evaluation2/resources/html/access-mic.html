    <p class="half-width blurb">
        <span class="italic">NVVI</span> (Non-verbal Vocal Interaction) is an interaction scheme that uses information from <span class="italic">non-speech</span> but still <span class="italic">vocal acoustics</span> as an input to a <span class="italic">controller</span> of sorts. To use it for this study, microphone access is needed. You can provide access to the microphone by clicking the button with the microphone image below.
