    <p class="half-width blurb">
        To specify when you want to use our NVVI tool, we decided that transient detection will be a way to toggle the abledness of our tool. In short, transient detection means a detection of some abrupt and atypically loud impulse in the audio signal. Our tool interprets TWO TRANSIENTS as a signal to toggle the tool on and off. You can play around with this below by snapping your fingers twice consecutively near the microphone!
