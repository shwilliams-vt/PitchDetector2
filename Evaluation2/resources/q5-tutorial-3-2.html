        To specify when you want to use our NVVI tool, we decided that <span class="italic">transient detection</span> will be a way to toggle the abledness of our tool. In short, <span class="italic">transient detection</span> means a detection of some abrupt and atypically loud impulse in the audio signal.

         Our tool interprets <span class="italic">TWO TRANSIENTS</span> as a signal to toggle the tool on and off. You can play around with this below by snapping your fingers twice consecutively near the microphone!
