        Phase 1 of this study will examine the effectiveness of using our tool to control HTML sliders. 
    </p>
    <p class="half-width blurb">
        You will be tasked with using our pitch-based NVVI tool described in the previous slide to control an HTML slider. By raising and lowering the pitch of your humming/whistling/singing, you are able to adjust the relative position of the slider. You will complete a series of these tasks.
