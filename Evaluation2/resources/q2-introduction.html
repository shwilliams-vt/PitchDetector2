    <h2 class="crimson">Welcome to a study on NVVI (Non-verbal Vocal Interaction)</h2>
    <p class="half-width blurb">
        In this study, you will be assessed by using an NVVI tool to complete tasks. In short, you will be using the <span class="italic">pitch</span> of your <span class="italic">voice, whistle, or hum,</span> to control a <span class="italic">one-dimensional parameter</span>. 
    </p>

        For example, you may control an HTML slider, but just think of a "parameter" as some value that can either increase or decrease. The pitch you produce can be analyzed as a numeric (continuous) value in Hertz. It that can then be determined if it is increasing or decreasing. Please speak with your proctor if you would like more explanation. Click continue when you are ready.
