    <h2 class="crimson">Welcome to a study on NVVI (Non-verbal Vocal Interaction)</h2>
    <p class="half-width blurb">
        In this study, you will be assessed by using an NVVI tool to complete tasks. In short, you will be using the pitch of your voice, whistle, or hum, to control a parameter. The parameter, for example, may control an HTML slider, but just think of a "parameter" as some sort of one-dimensional spectrum that can either increase or decrease in value. For example, the pitch you produce by humming can be analyzed as a numeric (continuous) value in Hertz and can be further analyzed if it is increasing or decreasing. Please speak with your proctor if you need a greater explanation.
