You either hum (harmonics/formants) or whistle (pure tone + small noise)

Humming will depend on vowel sound being used
- some have more harmonics than others
- some show harmonics lower than pitch being produced
- realistically:
-- not greater than 520 Hz 
-- not less than 90Hz

Whistling 
- pretty uniform
- range can vary from person to person
- many people can't whistle
- realistically:
-- not greater than 2.6Khz
-- not less than 600 Hz

Now a problem that comes up is sometimes people's voices are pure and when they
hum they register as a whistle. Sometimes, this is less than the 600 Hz guard.
So we choose to lower whistling to around 300 Hz, where formants really prevail. src

We need to balance change by frequency. Like high frequencies from whistling should change
proportional to low frequency changes in humming
