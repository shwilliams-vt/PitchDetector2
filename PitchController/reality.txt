You either hum (harmonics/formants) or whistle (pure tone + small noise)

Humming will depend on vowel sound being used
- some have more harmonics than others
- some show harmonics lower than pitch being produced
- realistically:
-- not greater than 520 Hz 
-- not less than 90Hz

Whistling 
- pretty uniform
- range can vary from person to person
- many people can't whistle
- realistically:
-- not greater than 2.6Khz
-- not less than 600 Hz
